# Uncomment 'changelog:' part and at least fill in correct 'section'
# from the provided list of valid sections above.
#
# First line of the commit message serves as a title in the changelog
# and thus should be very short.
#
# After an empty line you can add multi-line description of commit,
# feel free to be detailed.
#
# If you do not want to include your commit message into the changelog,
# you can use 'changelog: skip' and let rest of the changelog lines commented out.
#
# For more information how to use the tool, see README.md
