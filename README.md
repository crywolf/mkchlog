# Mkchlog

Changelog generator tool suitable for user-facing changelogs and based on experiences of existing projects.

## Overview

### The mkchlog command

Program has these two subcommands:

* `check` - will verify the structure of commit messages (all commits or since the specified commit number, tj. since the last version/in the PR). Intended to be used in CI on PRs.
* `gen` - will process git history and output the changelog in markdown format into a file/stdout.

The command is configured using `.mkchlog.yml` - a per-project configuration file.
This is created when project is started (or added later) and rarely needs to be changed.
The main input is in commit messages.

#### Basic usage example

`mkchlog check`

`mkchlog gen`

You can provide additional options:
* Commit number to start. This one and previous commits will be skipped. By default, all commit messages are checked.
* Config (template) file name [default value is `.mkchlog.yml`]
* Path to the git repository [default value is the current directory]

`mkchlog -c 7c85bee4303d56bededdfacf8fbb7bdc68e2195b -f .mkchlog.yml -g ../git-mkchlog-test/ gen`

Run `mkchlog help` for complete command documentation

### Example inputs

#### Config file

```yaml
# Possibly general settings here, probably none in the initial version

sections:
    # section identifier selected by project maintainer
    security:
        # The header presented to the user
        title: Security
        # desctiption is optional and will appear above changes
        description: This section contains very important security-related changes.
        subsections:
            vuln_fixes:
                title: Fix vulnerabilities
    features:
        title: New features
    perf:
        title: Performance improvements
```

#### Commits

```
Add ability to skip commits

This allows commits to be skipped by typing changelog: skip
at the end of the commit. This is mainly useful for typo
fixes or other things irrelevant to the user of a project.

changelog:
    inherit: all
    section: features
```

```
Fix grammar mistakes

We found 42 grammar mistakes that are fixed in this commit.

changelog: skip
```

```
Don't reallocate the buffer when we know its size

This computes the size and allocates the buffer upfront.
Avoiding allocations like this introduces 10% speedup.

changelog:
    section: perf
    title: Improve processing speed by 10%
    title-is-enough: true
```

```
Fix TOCTOU race condition when opening file

Previously we checked the file permissions before opening
the file now we check the metadata using file descriptor
after opening the file. (before reading)

changelog:
    section: security:vuln_fixes
    title: Fix vulnerability related to opening files
    description: The application was vulnerable to attacks
                 if the attacker had access to the working
                 directory. If you run this in such
                 enviroment you should update ASAP. If your
                 working directory is **not** accessible by
                 unprivileged users you don't need to worry.
```

### Example output

```markdown
## Security

This section contains very important security-related changes.

### Fix vulnerabilities

#### Fix vulnerability related to opening files

The application was vulnerable to attacks if the attacker had access to the working directory.
If you run this in such enviroment you should update ASAP.
If your working directory is **not** accessible by unprivileged users you don't need to worry.

## New features

This allows commits to be skipped by typing changelog: skip

## Performance improvements

### Explanation

(Rationale, idea and motivation by [Kixunil](https://github.com/Kixunil))

Commit messages should contain descriptive information about the change.
However not all of it is suitable to be in the changelog.
Each commit must be explicitly marked as either skipped or has some basic information filled.
Commits with `changelog: skip` will obviously not be included in the changelog.
Commits with `inherit: all` will simply include both title and description of the commit in the changelog.
This should be used when the commit message and description is equally useful for developers and users.
`inherit` could also accept additional options like `title` to only copy the title.
`section` is mandatory and defines in which section the change belongs.

`title` and `description` are those intended for the user.
The fictious "TOCTOU vulnerability fix" commit message above is hopefully a clear example.
For users it describes how it impacts them while for programmers it explains technical details of the issue.
`title-is-enough: true` explicitly opts-out of description, intended for situation when additional information is not needed for the user.

People refer to sections by their identifiers, not titles so that they don't accidentally duplicate the section just because of typo.
Unknown sections in commit messages are rejected.
Sections without commits are not present in the output at all so projects can have big templates without worrying about bloat.


This is based on these experiences:

* Editing a single file in PRs gets annoying with sufficient number of contributions
  because it causes frequent rebases with conflicts. Commit messages can not possibly cause conflicts.
* Sorting changes to categories later is difficult
  because it's hard to know if someone forgot to add a label on GitHub or the label is not appropriate.
  CI complaining about missing information prevents forgetting.

Additionally, we don't want to depend on GitHub so that we can migrate easily if needed - thus not pulling information from PRs.
