    Allow configuring commit ID in yaml

    Support building on Debian Bookworm

    This change lowers the requirements for dependencies so that the code
    compiles on Rust 1.63 which is in Debian Bookworm. Further, the
    dependencies are lowered such that the packages vendored in Debian
    Bookworm can be used directly.

    This uses version ranges so that the newest crates can still be used
    (they didn't break our code).

    Setup Github Actions

    This configures github actions to test `mkchlog` as well as run it on
    its own repository. Also moved `.mkchlog.yml`, which was used in test,
    to `tests/mkchlog.yml` and created custom `.mkchlog.yml` that's used in
    this project.

    The new `.mkchlog.yml` is heavily inspired by the original example with
    more sections, so we're more flexible in the future. Includes a section
    used in this commit. :)
